# SwiftUI

## Better apps. Less code.

SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs. With a declarative Swift syntax thatâ€™s easy to read and natural to write, SwiftUI works seamlessly with new Xcode design tools to keep your code and design perfectly in sync. SwiftUI is truly native, so your apps directly access the proven technologies of each platform to beautifully implement everything users love about the Apple ecosystem.
